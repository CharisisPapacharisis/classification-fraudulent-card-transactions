# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Classification Project

Credit card transactions are certainly all around us, and arguably the most popular means of completing purchases. Therefore, detecting fraudulent attempts is of paramount importance. Machine Learning (ML) can be of help towards this direction: the task of distinguishing valid versus fraudulent transactions can be viewed as an ML Classification problem.

For this project, I will use a dataset made public by the Machine Learning Group of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles). The datasets contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders, in September 2013.

For the implementation, I mainly used the libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

**Workflow followed**

The process I followed has generally been:

* Data loading
* Pre-processing & Data Exploration
* Assessing pathways of handling an imbalanced dataset
* Model Training & Performance Evaluation
* Tuning of model hyperparameters for the selected algorithm
